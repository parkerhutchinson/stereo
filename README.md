# STEREO.CODES #

This project, design, code, tests, and all the other cool stuff is a capabilities showcase. I created this solely to sell myself as a worthwhile investment for future employers. 

This project uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get up and running on webpack, tests, and React framework. The CSS is all component based using [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). TDD is what create-react-app implements with enzyme. In addition im using [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) to spy on component methods. There is some attempt at using [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to create a consistent component library.
